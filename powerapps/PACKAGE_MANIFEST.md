## CRITICAL: ZIP File Structure for Power Apps Import

⚠️ **IMPORTANT**: When creating the ZIP file for Power Apps import, ensure these files are at the ROOT level:
- `solution.xml`
- `customizations.xml`
- `[Content_Types].xml`

### Correct ZIP Structure:
```
GembaBoardSolution.zip
├── solution.xml                    ← Must be at root
├── customizations.xml              ← Must be at root
├── [Content_Types].xml             ← Must be at root
├── CanvasManifest.json
├── DEPLOYMENT_GUIDE.md
├── PACKAGE_MANIFEST.md
├── README.md
├── Src/
│   ├── App.fx.yaml
│   └── MainScreen.fx.yaml
├── DataSources/
│   ├── Metrics.json
│   └── ActionItems.json
├── Connections/

├── Entropy/

│   └── AppCheckerResult.sarif
├── Other/
│   └── Solution.xml
└── pkgs/
    └── Wadl/
```

### How to Create the Correct ZIP File:

1. **Select all files in the powerapps folder** (not the folder itself)
2. **Right-click and select "Compress" or "Add to ZIP"**
3. **Ensure the three required files are visible at the root when you open the ZIP**

### Common Mistakes to Avoid:
❌ **Don't ZIP the powerapps folder itself** - this puts files in a subfolder
❌ **Don't put files in subdirectories** - solution.xml must be at root level
❌ **Don't forget [Content_Types].xml** - this file is now included
